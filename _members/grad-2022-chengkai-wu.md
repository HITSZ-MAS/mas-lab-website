Hello, my name is Chengkai Wu. My interests lie in the fields of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), Mobile Manipulators and Motion Planning. Currently, I am pursuing my Master's degree in Automation at [Harbin Institute of Technology, Shenzhen](http://en.hitsz.edu.cn/), China, under the guidance of [Jie Mei](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=tyQm5IkAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN&oi=ao). Previously, in 2022, I obtained my Bachelor's degree in Electronic and Information Engineering in 2022 from [Xidian University](https://en.xidian.edu.cn/).
